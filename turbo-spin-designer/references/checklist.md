# Turbo Spin Checklist

## UX

- Turbo does not change outcomes or payout.
- Quick spin is slower than turbo and faster than normal.
- Spin button switches to Stop only while spinning.
- Speed toggle is locked during resolve.

## Readability

- Reels and wins are visible long enough to read.
- Bonus triggers are visible and not skipped.

## Compliance

- Auto-play confirmation remains required when auto-play is used.
- Social wording avoids restricted terms when applicable.
