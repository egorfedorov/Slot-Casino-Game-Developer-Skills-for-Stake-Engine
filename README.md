## 📦 How to Use

These skills are designed to be used with an AI agent capable of tool invocation. When you need to perform a specific task, simply invoke the corresponding skill tool.

**Example:**
> "I need to design the math for a new slot game with 96% RTP."

The agent will invoke `senior-game-math-engineer` to assist you.
