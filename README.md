## 📦 How to Use & Installation

You can use these skills as "Context Paks" or "Rule Sets" in your favorite AI-powered IDEs.

### 🔹 Trae & Windsurf
1.  Navigate to your project root.
2.  Create a folder named `.trae/skills` or `.windsurf/skills` (depending on your IDE).
3.  Copy the desired skill folders (e.g., `stake-game-developer`, `game-math-director`) into this directory.
4.  The IDE will automatically index these skills. You can now invoke them using `@` mention or natural language.

### 🔹 Cursor
1.  Create a `.cursorrules` file in your project root.
2.  Copy the content of the `SKILL.md` file from the specific skill you want to use.
3.  Paste it into `.cursorrules`.
4.  Alternatively, place the skill markdown files in a `docs/skills/` folder and reference them in your prompt using `@docs/skills/skill-name.md`.

### 🔹 ChatGPT / Claude / LLMs
1.  Simply copy the content of the `SKILL.md` file (and any referenced files in `references/`).
2.  Paste it into the chat as "Context" or "System Instruction".
3.  Tell the AI: *"Use the attached skill instructions to help me with [Task]."*
