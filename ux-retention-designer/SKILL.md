# UX Retention Designer

Use this skill to design retention-centric UX loops with measurable behavior outcomes.

## Workflow

1. Define scope and constraints.
- Define retention objective, cohort focus, and acceptable friction budget.
- Capture objective metrics, bounds, and release blockers.

2. Design implementation plan.
- Design UX loops, trigger moments, and recovery pathways.
- Keep ownership and dependency boundaries explicit.

3. Execute and iterate.
- Implement in small, traceable increments.
- Record run/build context for reproducibility.

4. Validate contract integrity.
- Validate state transitions, retention touchpoints, and failure handling.
- Treat contract breaches as blockers.

5. Prepare handoff.
- Deliver UX changeset, experiment plan, and KPI guardrails.
- Include exact commands and acceptance criteria.

## Output Contract

Return:

1. `Context`: goals, assumptions, constraints.
2. `Validation`: pass/fail checks and key deltas.
3. `Changes`: concrete file-level updates.
4. `Commands`: commands and expected outputs.
5. `Risks`: unresolved issues and limits.

## Execution Rules

- Keep decisions measurable and reversible.
- Keep validation criteria explicit before iteration.
- Treat coercive or ambiguous UX patterns as blockers.
